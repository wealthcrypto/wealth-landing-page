    {
      question: "What if I can't attend an experience I reserved?",

      category: "experiences"
    },
    {
      question: "Is my investment in WEALTH safe?",
      answer: "While all investments carry some risk, WEALTH is built for long-term value creation through real-world utility, not speculation.
